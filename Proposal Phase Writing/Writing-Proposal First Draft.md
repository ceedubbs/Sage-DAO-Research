The rise of digital work environments and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have challenged traditional frameworks of organizational economics, specifically in the changing dynamics of principal-agent relationships.This paper focuses on one intriguing facet of this evolution: the negotiation of transparency in administrative systems. In conditions of information asymmetry, the principal and the agent are likely to have divergent objectives and risk preferences leading to agency costs. With the advent of online work and DAOs, the nation of information asymmetry has evolved, compelling the examination of the implication of transparency in digital work environments. While transparency promises to foster trust and cooperation, too much of it may lead to concealment and mistrust, crippling spontaneity and innovation (Bernstein 2014). Conversely, a lack of transparency could breed inefficiency and misaligned incentives, undermining the principal-agent relationship. Our goal of this paper is to explore this delicate balance, with the spotlight on various occupational demands in digital working environments, such as route work, creative tasks, and moral decisions. 

Flexible working was one of the many byproducts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and flexible working is projected to continue to be the norm in the post pandemic era. Roughly 58% of Americans have the option to work remotely at least part of the time, and 87% of Americans reported that they would work flexibly if they're given the chance (McKinsey 2022). Also In 2023, DAOs are propertied to have over $25 billion dollars combined under its management (Cointelegraph 2023). Given the seismic shift in working habits, and the proven success of DAOs, organizations across the globe are grappling with finding the sweet spot between transparency and privacy, seeking to optimize productivity in a digital setting. Our investigation offers timely insights into the nature of virtual collaboration. Our results are especially pertinent for DAOs, which operate primarily in the digital domain where the rules of engagement are still being written. Moreover, our study is unique in that it investigates the role and impact of transparency within online collaborative environments—an area not extensively covered in the current scholarship. 

So, how does the level of transparency in governance systems affect productivity and the relationships between principals and agents in the context of online collaborative settings? To answer this, we use an innovative experimental design that leverages game theory to simulate real-world scenarios. We examine how varying levels of transparency and monitoring affect effort, productivity, and perceived compensation—key variables that define the principal-agent relationship. Transparency, in this context, is represented by the extend of which information about task complexity and monitoring mechanisms are disclosed. In doing so, we also anchor our investigation in the principal-agent theory, offering an economic perspective to the discourse on transparency.

Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. Firstly, it explores a relatively under-researched area—transparency in online collaborative settings—thus enriching the existing discourse. Secondly, by examining transparency through an economic lens, we offer fresh insights into its effects on productivity and the principal-agent relationship. Lastly, our findings can help optimize digital work environments and DAOs, thereby having practical implications for the evolving digital work landscape....
