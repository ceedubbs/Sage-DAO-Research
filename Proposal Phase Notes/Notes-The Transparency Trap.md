**Summary:**
>By balancing transparency and privacy, organizations can capture the benefits of both, and encourage just the right amount of “positive deviance” needed to increase innovation and productivity

- Overdoing transparency can be harmful to the organizations 
	- Employees may hide improvements/progress in fear that management won't understand/punish them for it
	- Employees will go to length to hide activity even when they're not being malicious 
- **Four types of boundaries to establish privacy:**


	- Boundaries around individual teams
		- The prevented crowd scrutiny 
		- When everything is monitored we're spending more time acting
		- Areas of transparency matters

		>tools that separate data-informed feedback from the evaluation process help lower people’s defenses and put the focus squarely on productivity and problem solving, where you want it.
		

	- Boundaries between feedback and evals
		- Delineating zones of judgment
		- Prevent wasted efforts on impressions
		- Look at the success of work.com
		- Trucker dash cam: 
			- Noting without fear of exposing increased productivity


	- Boundaries between decision and improvement rights
		- Experimentation is required for innovation, but employees might fear experimentation because of scruitany
			- Urge to get it right

	- Boundaries around periods of experimentation
		- Avoid frequent and infrequent interruptions
