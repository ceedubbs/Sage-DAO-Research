**Introduction**

>The most well-known of these asymmetric game problems are moral hazard, principal-agent games - games in which one of the players (the agent) is informed about a key aspect of the game while the other (the principal) is not. We found the lack of classroom experiments involving such games surprising and unsatisfying because they have become a prominent staple in many textbooks as in Stiglitz [1993]; Colander [1995]; Carlton and Perloff [1995]; and Mishkin [1995]. This note addresses the imbalance. We describe a simple, flexible and instructive moral hazard experiment for use in a variety of classes, including introductory courses. The experiment can be used to illustrate the importance of information, and the power of reputational enforcement in principal-agent interactions. Such issues are the key for an understanding of modern theories of the firm, such as Holmstrom and Tirole [1989], Kreps [1990a; 1990b], Stiglitz [1993], Carlton and Perloff [1995], and Mishkin [1995], and the role of market forces in assuring contractual performance as in Klein and Leffler [1981]. We begin by discussing prisoner's dilemma and principal-agent games and their relevance to economics. Then we describe the experiment and its likely results.


Principle agent games involve moral hazard and are asymmetrical: players have varied info, varid choices

	In the simplest version of this asymmetric game the two players can choose between two actions each so that there are four possible outcomes. To formally specify the dilemma of trust, the game must be parameterized by assigning values to the outcomes. For the parameterization to reflect the moral hazard problem, the values chosen must be sufficient to give the agent an incentive to choose the individually advantageous, rather than the collectively desirable choice.

A game example:

	Thus, if the buyer does not inspect and the repair person provides a high quality repair, they both receive a benefit of 1. This can be thought of as the cooperative outcome. If the repair person provides a low quality repair, she doubles her benefit to 2 while the buyer is worse off; in fact, the buyer incurs a loss of 1 because he pays the price of high quality service without getting it. The buyer, knowing the repair person's temptation, thus has a strong incentive to inspect. However, the payoff of both participants is 0 if he should do so.

-Note: We could possibly set it up where there cost of information becomes lowered.
