Smart contract enforcement: to what degree are blockchain constitutions referencing smart contracts, and is there space to operate beyond these coded boundaries?

Hypothesis: Low degrees of smart contract enforcement is an optimal balance for creating communities of scale. However, major contractual/constitutional incompleteness is addressed with an open, guiding principles clause that is enforced through a court like system.

Experiment Design: 

1. Field study: Find DAOs that have varying degrees of smart contract enforcement, then record their “community health metric.” This could be the DAO’s AUM, discord members to engagement ratio, proposal engagement ratio etc. Then correlate the degrees of smart contract enforcement to the community health


- Pros:
	- Low cost data acquisition
	- Constitution database already exists
		- https://github.com/metagov/constitution-template/tree/main/constitutions
	- I can learn about and interact with many communities 
- Cons:
	- Not much external validity in terms of beyond the DAO space
	-
