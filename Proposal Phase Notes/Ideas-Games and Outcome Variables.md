**1. Trust Game:**

One player (the principal) receives an endowment that they can choose to keep or send to the second player (the agent). The amount sent to the agent is then multiplied, and the agent decides how much to return to the principal. The levels of transparency can be varied as follows:

- **Low transparency:** The principal does not know how much the initial endowment was multiplied by before it was given to the agent.

- **High transparency:** The principal knows the multiplication factor and can calculate the maximum possible return.

**2. Public Goods Game:**

Each player receives an endowment and can choose how much to contribute to a common pool. The total contributions are multiplied and then divided equally among all players, regardless of their contribution. The transparency can be adjusted as follows:

- **Low transparency:** Players do not know how much others have contributed until the end of the game.
- **High transparency:** Players see contributions from others in real time.

**3. Principal-Agent Game:**

The principal hires the agent to perform a task. The agent has private information about the cost or effort required to perform the task, which they can choose to hide or reveal. Transparency can be varied as:

- **Low transparency:** The agent's cost/effort information is private.
- **High transparency:** The agent's cost/effort information is visible to the principal.

Outcome Variable: 
- Level of effort exerted by the agent in the Principal-Agent Game

Potential outcome variables:
- Amount sent back by the agent in the Trust Game
- Amount contributed to the public good in the Public Goods Game
- Level of effort exerted by the agent in the Principal-Agent Game
