Abstract: A growing literature explores the impact of home-based versus office-based work. Differences in productivity may arise due to a treatment effect of the office or from workers with different abilities sorting into office or home work. ==We conduct an RCT in the data entry sector in India that exogenously allocates workers to the home or office. We find that the productivity of workers randomly assigned to working from home is 18% lower than those in the office. ==Two-thirds of the effect manifests itself from the first day of work with the remainder due to quicker learning by office workers over time. We find negative selection effects for office-based work: workers who prefer home-based work are 12% faster and more accurate at baseline. We also find a negative selection on treatment: workers who prefer home work are substantially less productive at home than at the office (27% less compared to 13% less for workers who prefer the office). These negative selection effects are partially explained by subgroups that likely face bigger constraints on selecting into office work, such as those with children or other home care responsibilities as well as poorer households.

1.1
- Sources on heightened interest in WFH:
	- Barrero et al.(2021), Bloom et al. (2022), Brynjolfsson et al. (2020), and Emanuel and Harrington (2023).
- Where do productivity differences originate: 
	- Production difference from home vs office - equipment, resources
	- Learning is faster in organized setting
		- as explored in Bloom et al. (2014), Bloom et al. (2022), Kaur et al. (2015), and Schoar (2009)
	- Self selection bias from high ability workers preferring to work in offices, therefore leading to conclusion that office work is more productive
		- Skewing average productivity of office workers upwards
	- On the flipside, high ability workers might prefer WFH, leading to an upwards skew for WFH productivity
	- Selection on treatment effect: workers choosing work location based on where they anticipate they'll be most effective in
	- Social commitments at home that hinders high productivity workers
- Further self selection from workers acknowledging that office work might yield greater incentives because they're easier to monitor-therefore higher likelihood of promotion or reward

3.2 Recruitment and Sample Selection
- Posted advertisement for data entry job in newpaper
- Posted two ads, results from ads had limited heterogeneity so results were combined
- Scouted for 18-40 y/o in lower middle class (target population)
- Metrics to find baseline stats:
	- Initial typing speed & accuracy
	- Choose preference between WFH or office

3.4 Compensation Structure
- Fixed component + Performance based variable
	- fixed 128.80 a month when 35 hr/wk of work is completed + certain number of tasks
		- Tasks incrementally increased in difficulty to accommodate learning
	- $1 of bonus given for every task completed beyond target
	- $30 retention bonus after week 1
- Penalization to increase accuracy
	- For error rates between 0-7.5% for easy task 0-15% for hard tasks. 1.5 times error rate was deducted. Anything greater was deducted 2 time error rate
3.5 Outcome Measures
 - Hiring process surveyed: demographics, education data entry and other work experience, employment status, job search, work preference, and family care and other commitments.
 - During training, further survey conducted on: household characteristics, income, social and economic status, computer literacy. They also completed aptitude tests, personality test, risk preference test and time preference test.
 - To measure baseline ability:
	 - Typing speed test, cash incentivized and non incentivized speed test
- Hired devs to make special data entry software:
	- Tracked keystrokes typed
	- Accuracy
		- Proportion of correct entries to total entries
	- Time spend working or idle
	- Main productivity measure:
		- Net typing speed
			- Correct entries typed per minute
-
