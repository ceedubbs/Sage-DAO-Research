**Abstract:**

>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a rapid shift to full-time remote work for many information workers. Viewing this shift as a natural experiment in which some workers were already working remotely before the pandemic enables us to separate the effects of firm-wide remote work from other pandemic-related confounding factors. Here, we use rich data on the emails, calendars, instant messages, video/audio calls and workweek hours of 61,182 US Microsoft employees over the first six months of 2020 to estimate the causal effects of firm-wide remote work on collaboration and communication. Our results show that firm-wide remote work caused the collaboration network of workers to become more static and siloed, with fewer bridges between disparate parts. Furthermore, there was a decrease in synchronous communication and an increase in asynchronous communication. Together, these effects may make it harder for employees to acquire and share new information across the network.

**Network Topology:** Arrangements or pattern of connections in a network

- Access to formal and informal networks are crucial for workers to access non-redundant information.
	-  Linking different parts of network "bridging structural holes," improves the flow of information within the organizations
- Strength in individual ties are imperative for "knowledge transfers"
	- Increased sense of trust, tendency to cooperate, and to ensure that knowledge is properly transferred
- Weak ties also may be beneficial to non-redundant info, as they're less costly to maintain and have access to wider circles
