**Abstract**

>In this paper, we conduct an analysis of 19 DAO constitutions, observe a number of common patterns, and provide a set of recommendations to support the crafting and dissemination of future DAO constitutions. The text of these constitutions vary from 300-word blog posts to to 30-page legal charters, reflecting the variety of intended audiences, maturity of community, and document purpose. However, despite their differences, each constitution can be productively understood as part of a broader discourse around governance within the emerging DAO ecosystem.

Uniqueness of new age DAO constitutions: 
1. The documents guide communities that manage more assets than before
2. Smart contracts are used to enforce these constitutions

Restrictions of smart contracts:
- "Tend to only be relevant for a small set of transactions"
- "Not feasible nor (arguably) desirable to include all norms within smart contracts"
- Encoding digital rights can be barrier of entry/useless for those who can't read code

Content of this essay and aims:
1. to understand and contextualize the usage of written constitutions and smart contracts within the emerging politics of DAOs
2. to analyze these textual documents in their own right
3. to develop a stable set of principles and practices for future DAO constitutions.

Collection of Internet Manifestos: Redeker, Gil, and Gasser (Redeker et al., 2018)

	"Constitutions can thus be understood as an interface for a community’s shared values."

Methodology:
- Matching stated values to code

Document Structures:
1. "Some are modeled on the modern notion of the constitution with separate "articles" that define specific subsets of rights and responsibilities.
2. Others emulate the manifesto form with an expression of values and intent along with a set of guidelines to follow.
3. Some read more like documentation to a software project.
4. Yet others appear to be narrating a hero's journey (a narrative archetype popularly theorized by Joseph Campbell)."
- Documents are often written in different dialects/"registers", some more formal than others: "legalese", "officialness","kumbaya"

- NOTE: Definitions of what these terms mean vary community to community 

	"Scholars have generally agreed that there is no common definition for decentralization (Schneider, 2019) and in the context of blockchain, “decentralization” is the “boundary object”(Star & Griesemer, 1989) that enables individuals from different communities to work together."

- Rights are more than just values because they're translated into code

Space of Innovation:

	But to what extent _should_ constitutions reference the smart contract?

	To understand how governance smart contracts function on their own and in conjunction with textual constitutions or other governance documents and processes, we must investigate three distinct data sets:
	
	1. the rights and affordances defined within the template smart contracts,
	2. the parameter configurations with which DAOs have chosen to deploy their own computational governance systems from template smart contracts, and
	3. the resulting governance activity circumscribed by the smart contracts.

	#### Future work
	
	Beyond analyzing smart contracts, there is still much work to be done to expand the dataset of textual documents and to contextualize their creation and use. We hope to continue building our dataset not only by lowering the friction of contributing data but also by automating certain aspects of data collection, especially through improvements to our template or to the associated tools and widgets in the code repository.
	
	Additionally, further information is needed to understand the relationship between the structure and contents of a textual constitution and its observed usage in governing a community. For what audiences was the constitution written, and how does its publishing location relate to these? What are the processes by which the constitution was created, and who was involved in its drafting and revision? In what ways and with what frequency is the constitution being referenced and revisited by the community it governs?

Notes: To what extent should constitutions be the relational governing mechanism? Should there me a catch all mechanism to enforce relational contracts/social norms?
