> Berg, Davidson and Potts (2019a,b) and Davidson, De Filippi and Potts (2018) argue that blockchain technology and smart contracts suppress opportunism

- This paper argues that corperate governance mechanisms are more appropriate for governing blockchains
- There are varied definitions on trust

	>For example, Hurwitz (2013: 1584) defines trust as being ‘reliance without recourse’, while Werbach (2018: 25) defines trust as being ‘confident vulnerability’.

>Building on Lord Keynes’ (1937) definition of risk, Berg, Davidson and Potts (forthcoming) argue that the existence trust alleviates or ameliorates the doubts that a transaction will be executed as negotiated.

			Trust gets rid of doubt that contractual promises will be fufilled

Note: Transparency -> trust -> lower tendency to defect/more aligned interests. Another thing to consider, is how social factors play into the prevention of shading

**3. Corporate Governance**

- Note the distinction of traditional "capitalist corperations," and "cooperatives and worker owned firms"

From Shleifer and Vishny (1997):

>Corporate governance deals with the ways in which suppliers of finance to corporations assure themselves of getting a return on their investment. How do the suppliers of finance get managers to return some of the profits to them? How do they make sure that managers do not steal the capital they supply or invest it in bad projects? How do suppliers of finance control managers?

- Managers have power in decision making, but relatively little power in "cashflow" rights

>Jensen and Meckling (1976) have defined agency costs as being the sum of monitoring costs (outsiders monitor insiders to ensure their interests are being pursued), bonding costs (insiders signal to outsiders that they are trustworthy agents), and a residual loss (unresolved disputes that impose costs on the relationship despite both monitoring and bonding behaviour).

- Agency cost = monitoring costs + bonding costs + residual loss
- Jenson (1993) Argued that 4 forces controls the alignment of principal and agent in firms: Capital markets, political and regulatory systems, product and factor markets, and international control systems.

- (Fama and Jenson 1983b) Decision management = proposal initiation -> implementation. Decision control = proposal approval -> monitoring
	- Management -> decision management
	- Board -> decision control

From Fama and Jensen (1983b):

>An organization is the nexus of contracts, written and unwritten, among owners of factors of production and customers. These contracts or internal ‘’rules of the game” specify the rights of each agent in the organization, performance criteria on which agents are evaluated, and the payoff functions they face. … The central contracts in any organization specify (1) the nature of residual claims and (2) the allocation of the steps of the decision process among agents.

Notes: DAOs too is a nexus of contracts-smart contracts, but inevitably incomplete

==**Maladaptation:** Mismatch in contracting when real-world circumstances change, which would necessitate re-negotiation. ==

==**Hold-up Problems:** Exploitation/opportunism that happens during the renegotiation of contracts==

- Smart Contracts and mitigate opportunism, but doesn't prevent maladaptation and hold-up problems
	- Governance mechanisms need to be in place to address these incompletenesses

- Who gets to "monitor the nexus of smart contracts" to amend software bugs and attacks?
