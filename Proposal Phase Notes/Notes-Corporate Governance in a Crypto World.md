> Berg, Davidson and Potts (2019a,b) and Davidson, De Filippi and Potts (2018) argue that blockchain technology and smart contracts suppress opportunism

- This paper argues that corperate governance mechanisms are more appropriate for governing blockchains
- There are varied definitions on trust

	>For example, Hurwitz (2013: 1584) defines trust as being ‘reliance without recourse’, while Werbach (2018: 25) defines trust as being ‘confident vulnerability’.

>Building on Lord Keynes’ (1937) definition of risk, Berg, Davidson and Potts (forthcoming) argue that the existence trust alleviates or ameliorates the doubts that a transaction will be executed as negotiated.

			Trust gets rid of doubt that contractual promises will be fufilled

Note: Transparency -> trust -> lower tendency to defect/more aligned interests. Another thing to consider, is how social factors play into the prevention of shading

**3. Corporate Governance**

- Note the distinction of traditional "capitalist corperations," and "cooperatives and worker owned firms"

From Shleifer and Vishny (1997):

>Corporate governance deals with the ways in which suppliers of finance to corporations assure themselves of getting a return on their investment. How do the suppliers of finance get managers to return some of the profits to them? How do they make sure that managers do not steal the capital they supply or invest it in bad projects? How do suppliers of finance control managers?

- Managers have power in decision making, but relatively little power in "cashflow" rights

>Jensen and Meckling (1976) have defined agency costs as being the sum of monitoring costs (outsiders monitor insiders to ensure their interests are being pursued), bonding costs (insiders signal to outsiders that they are trustworthy agents), and a residual loss (unresolved disputes that impose costs on the relationship despite both monitoring and bonding behaviour).

- Agency cost = monitoring costs + bonding costs + residual loss
- Jenson (1993) Argued that 4 forces controls the alignment of principal and agent in firms: Capital markets, political and regulatory systems, product and factor markets, and international control systems.
