**Abstract**

>Most analyses of the principal-agent problem assume that the principal chooses an incentive scheme to maximize expected utility subject to the agent’s utility being at a stationary point. An important paper of Mirrlees has shown that this approach is generally invalid. We present an alternative procedure. If the agent’s preferences over income lotteries are independent of action, we show that the optimal way of implementing an action by the agent can be found by solving a convex programming problem. We use this to characterize the optimal incentive scheme and to analyze the determinants of the seriousness of an incentive problem.

**Principle Agent Problem**: when the agent is able to make decisions on behalf of the principle, and their interests are not perfectly aligned
- ex: a company's shareholders are looking to maximize profits, while the managers are looking to grow the business, posing conflicting short term interests

**Income Lotteries**: situation where agent's income is uncertain ad dependent on outcomes. "Independent of their actions" suggests that they don't care about the action that lead to the income itself, only the income.

*Ideas*: the principal (DAO token holders ) has direct control of the agent's (operators) actions. Therefore it is difficult for agent to do anything that is unaligned with the principal. But in this case, the principal and agents are one.

>Suppose that one of the individuals (known as the agent) is to take an action which the other individual (known as the principal) cannot observe, Assume that this action affects the total amount of consumption or money which is available to be divided between the two individuals. In general, the action which is optimal for the agent will depend on the extent of risk sharing between the principal and the agent. The question is: What is the optimal degree of risk sharing, given this dependence?

>Particular applications of the principal-agent problem have been made to the case of an insurer who cannot observe the level of care taken by the person being insured; to the case of a landlord who cannot observe the input decision of a tenant farmer (sharecropping); and to the case of an owner of a firm who cannot observe the effort level of a manager or worker. 2
