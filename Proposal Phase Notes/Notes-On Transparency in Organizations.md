[[On Transparency in Organizations Jehiel.pdf]]

**Abstract:**

>When is it best for the Principal to commit to not disclosing all that he/she knows in moral hazard interactions? I show that whenever the Agent would choose the same action under complete information at several distinct states, then full transparency can generically be improved upon. This implies that full transparency is generically suboptimal whenever the dimension of the information held by the Principal exceeds the dimension of the Agentâ€™s action. In a simple class of problems, I make further progress on the best disclosure policy assuming the Principal can either disclose fully the state or remain silent.

Jehiel's policies on transparency:
- Full: agent is informed on the monitoring technology of the principle and the scope of difficulty of the task
- Less: agent is unaware of some info until the completion of task

The question Jehiel's answering: Is it optimal for the principal to fully disclose what they know in a "moral hazard" situation where the Agent might take advantage of asymmetric information

**Key Takeaways**

1. **Non-transparency can be Optimal**: The author finds that in certain situations, it may be beneficial for the Principal not to fully disclose all information to the Agent. This is especially the case when the same action would be chosen by the agent(s) in at least two distinct states under complete information.
    
2. **Prevalence of Non-transparency**: Given that the state (the situation the Agent has to respond to) is likely to be more complex than the action (the Agent's response) in most real-world situations, the author suggests that some form of non-transparency is likely to be optimal in a wide range of applications.
    
3. **Guidelines for Non-disclosure**: The article provides insights into the best ways to implement non-disclosure. For example, it suggests when tasks in organizations should not be described in great detail, which can be a form of non-transparency.
