**Abstract**

>Blockchains represent a novel application of cryptography and information technology to age-old problems of financial record-keeping, and they may lead to far-reaching changes in corporate governance. Many major players in the financial industry have began to invest in this new technology, and stock exchanges have proposed using blockchains as a new method for trading corporate equities and tracking their ownership. This essay evaluates the potential implications of these changes for managers, institutional investors, small shareholders, auditors, and other parties involved in corporate governance. The lower cost, greater liquidity, more accurate record-keeping, and transparency of ownership offered by blockchains may significantly upend the balance of power among these cohorts.

For Managers:
- Transparent managerial ownership
- Managerial asset flow is trackable
- Backdating and manipulating compensation difficult 
	- Bc blockchains are immutable
For Principal:
- Shareholder governance becomes much easier
- Quicker & cheaper acquisition of shares
- Less secrecy
- Easier to liquidate 
- Real time observation of shares & ownership transfers
- Greater transparency of ownership, cheaper trade, execution and settlement makes for greater profit opportunities to managers, institutional investors and shareholder activists.

3.1 Greater Transparency of Ownership
- When building on public blockchains, issuing equity might prompt greater consumer reaction?? Stock traders receive more financial metrics to make decisions
- Public blockchains may protect companies from hostile raiders/takeovers and shareholder activists

3.4 Impact on Managers
- Blockchain based share might reduce effectiveness of equity based management incentives
	- Insider trading as an effective incentive system that aligns managers' and shareholder interests
- Transparency of trading may be scrutinized by board and public (social pressure)
- Can enable relative performance evaluations

3.6 Voting in Corporate Elections
3.8 Smart Contracts
