**Abstract:**
>_DAOs, or_ [_decentralized autonomous organizations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)_, are technical tools written in code and run on blockchains, but they are also_ **_a new kind of social institution_**_. Early explorations of DAOs focused more on their technical development and less on their social implications, leading to a series of failures that exposed the limitations of a rigid, “_[_code is law_](https://www.coindesk.com/code-is-law-not-quite-yet)_” approach to the design of DAOs. In this article, we explore a more holistic approach to DAOs, one that integrates technical engineering with social design. We call this approach the institutional view._


-Institutions: stable patterns for regulating human behavior

-Computational Constitution: "the portion of a constitution which is made up of software" 

-DAO is not just the code, but the sum of all the parts of the org

-Constitutions social contracts for DAO participants

-Note: Josh has been invested in constitutional economics of DAOs since the start

-Constitutions are non-defined in nature, providing more of a framework for action and development, therefore it can never be fully reduced to "an algorithmic representation."

-For successful "constitutional patterns," study Ostrom. She's like the holy mother for the DAO space. 
	-Examples: monitoring systems, community consultations
