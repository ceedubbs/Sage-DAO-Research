The rise of digital work environments and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have challenged traditional frameworks of organizational economics, specifically in the changing dynamics of principal-agent relationships. This paper focuses on one intriguing facet of this evolution: the negotiation of transparency in administrative systems. In conditions of information asymmetry, the principal and the agent are likely to have divergent objectives and risk preferences leading to agency costs. With the advent of online work and DAOs, the nature of information asymmetry has evolved, compelling the examination of the how different modes of transparency impact digital work environments. While transparency promises to foster trust and cooperation, too much of it may lead to concealment and mistrust, crippling spontaneity and innovation (Bernstein 2014). Conversely, a lack of transparency could breed inefficiency and misaligned incentives, undermining the principal-agent relationship. Our goal of this paper is to explore this delicate balance, with the spotlight on various occupational demands in digital working environments, such as route work, creative tasks, and moral decisions. 

Flexible working was one of the many byproducts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and flexible working is projected to continue to be the norm in the post pandemic era. Roughly 58% of Americans have the option to work remotely at least part of the time, and 87% of Americans reported that they would work flexibly if they're given the chance (McKinsey 2022). Also In 2023, DAOs are propertied to have over $25 billion dollars combined under its management (Cointelegraph 2023). Given the seismic shift in working habits, and the proven success of DAOs, organizations across the globe are grappling with finding the sweet spot between transparency and privacy, seeking to optimize productivity in a digital setting. Our investigation offers timely insights into the nature of virtual collaboration. Our results are especially pertinent for DAOs, which operate primarily in the digital domain where the rules of engagement are still being written. Moreover, our study is unique in that it investigates the role and impact of transparency within online collaborative environments—an area not extensively covered in the current scholarship. 

So, how does the level of transparency in governance systems affect productivity and the relationships between principals and agents in the context of online collaborative settings? To answer this, we use an innovative experimental design that leverages game theory to simulate real-world scenarios. We examine how varying levels of transparency and monitoring affect effort, productivity, and perceived compensation—key variables that define the principal-agent relationship. Transparency, in this context, is represented by the extend of which information about task complexity and monitoring mechanisms are disclosed. In doing so, we also anchor our investigation in the principal-agent theory, offering an economic perspective to the discourse on transparency.

The existing literature offers a rich tapestry of insights into the themes of remote work, transparency, productivity, and the principal-agent relationship. The evidence from various methodologies, ranging from experimental design to analytical modeling, reveals a nuanced and multifaceted picture. The focus on different industries, such as data entry, information technology, and general labor markets, provides a broad understanding but also hints at the need for context-specific analysis. Certain limitations, such as non-specified constraints in some studies and the challenge of measuring alternative work in household surveys, point to areas where further investigation is warranted.

Our study seeks to build on these foundational insights by delving into the delicate balance between transparency and privacy in online collaborative settings and DAOs, thereby addressing an area not extensively covered in the current scholarship. By adopting an innovative experimental design and game theory, this research aims to contribute a fresh economic perspective to the ongoing discourse on transparency and collaboration in the digital work environment.

#### **1. Work from Home and Productivity**

The productivity implications of remote work have been examined from various angles. Atkin et al. (2023) conducted a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in India, focusing on the data entry sector. They discovered an 18% higher productivity in office settings, with significant selection effects. This finding contrasts with Barrero et al.'s (2023) survey results, revealing a growing trend toward hybrid work, with 59% of employees in tech, finance, and professional services preferring this model. Interestingly, they found that hybrid workers engage more interactions, thus contributing differently to productivity.

Katz and Krueger (2019) also highlighted the rise of alternative work arrangements, including the gig economy and self-employment, stressing the need for consistent survey methods to accurately assess these trends.

#### **2. Collaboration in Remote Work Environments**

Yang et al.'s (2022) natural experiment involving U.S. Microsoft employees provides insights into how remote work impacts collaboration. Their findings reveal that remote work leads to a more static and siloed collaboration network, with an increase in asynchronous communication and potential challenges in information convergence. These findings underscore the complexity of optimizing collaboration in digital work environments.

#### **3. Transparency in Organizational Settings**

The economics of transparency has been explored by researchers like Jehiel (2014), who through analytical modeling found non-transparency can sometimes be optimal and provided guidelines for non-disclosure. Conversely, Bernstein (2014) emphasized that balancing transparency and privacy can optimize innovation and productivity, warning that over-transparency could be counterproductive.

Gierlich-Joas et al.'s (2020) conceptual work on "inverse transparency" introduces a novel perspective, stressing the value of digital leadership innovations and empowerment of employees.

#### **4. Principal-Agent Problem and Organizational Behavior**

The classic work by Sanford et al. (1983) on the principal-agent problem offers a mathematical analysis of optimal incentive schemes and the dual role of the agent's output in consumption and information signaling. This study, although based on strong assumptions, lays the foundation for understanding the complexity of principal-agent relationships in modern contexts, including online collaborative settings.
